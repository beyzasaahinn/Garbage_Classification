Solid Waste Classification Using CNN
This project focuses on the classification of solid waste using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The goal is to categorize waste into six different classes based on images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named TrashNet, created by Stanford University students. 
It consists of a total of 2,527 images, categorized into six different classes:
501 Glass
594 Paper
403 Cardboard
482 Plastic
410 Metal
137 Trash
All images are taken under white light, placed against a white panel using natural light or room lighting, and have a resolution of 512 x 384 pixels with 3 (RGB) channels.

Dataset Processing
Google Drive Connection: The dataset was uploaded to Google Drive and connected to Google Colab for seamless data handling.
Labeling: The images in the dataset were unlabeled. Using the folder names, I labeled the data manually.
Data Augmentation: Since the images were taken under white light, data augmentation techniques were applied to better mimic real-world conditions and enhance the dataset diversity.
Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and color adjustments were used to increase robustness.
